Some of the world�s most prominent industry leaders, from telecommunication giants to technology power houses entrust STARTEK to uphold their reputations and to safe-guard their hard-won customers.

We work around the clock, around the world, and with great determination to ensure every customer interaction is one that authentically matters. It�s on this front line, in the moments of direct, person-to-person engagement, where the battle for customer loyalty lives or dies, and why we take our responsibility so seriously.

Every one of our centers has a program dedicated to improving and supporting the communities they are a part of through direct involvement and volunteerism. While we know paying it forward feels great, it also just makes good business sense. We�ve seen first hand what third party studies reinforce all the time � that engaged employees who have a sense of belonging, also have less absenteeism, lower turnover and are more profitable.

In addition to taking care of the communities our sites are in, STARTEK prides itself in taking care of one another during times of hardship as well. In 2014, STARTEK launched WIN (Warriors In Need), a foundation intended to provide basic necessities and temporary relief to any STARTEK employee as result of disaster or extraordinary life events.

The program was conceived by employees, for employees, and is primarily funded by STARTEK employee contributions to help one another in times of great need. The program is in its infancy, but has already proven to be an essential resource for facing a critical crisis."

One incident can destroy a family�s future and development. We hope no one ever faces such a situation, but the truth is millions of people do. Unlike European countries we have poor social security. The rich can still recover from the financial loss, but the poor cannot recover from such a loss easily. Thus we believe we do a noble act by building awareness about such a product. We are against miss selling. Millions of people every year buy Insurance policies without understanding as they are usually told just a few things to sell the product. Many times these are lies or half-truths; as such commitments are rarely documented or recorded. Thus customers start hating insurance and its sellers hurting persistency and growth. This is no way to build a sustainable business. We believe everyone must fully understand what they are buying, and know both the positives and the negatives. They should know the options, and choose what is best for them and their needs. The true value of any insurance policy lies in the payment of a claim, and we will fight the corner of a customer very hard indeed, at the point of claim, and ensure he gets a fair deal from the insurance company. Finally we believe companies must make a profit too, else how can they continue to service customers. Thus we are against customer side fraud. We like customers to make truthful declarations, and not try to cheat the system.

NoBroker is a platform that removes this information asymmetry and provides a marketplace for free exchange of this information that used to cost 1-2 months of rent as brokerage. We have done 2 things to help you find that perfect home:Firstly, we have painstakingly verified each listing and made sure that these are direct owners or shared accommodation parties and there are no middlemen or brokers. We use lot of heuristics and techniques to ensure that you get a totally broker free list.Secondly, we have also tried to ensure that maximum information is available to you in as easy to use format. This ensures that you get a very good idea of the property even before you visit it. Thus, you can shortlist flats sitting at the comfort of your home without actually traveling all the good and bad properties. This saves your time and effort and with a quick shortlist of 4-5 properties you can actually get a house in few hours!

If you are a landlord interested in posting your apartments to NoBroker, please email us at hello@nobroker.in and we will get in touch to help you list the property.

ESAF started it�s journey as an NGO during the year 1992, with a larger vision of sustainable and holistic transformation of the poor and the marginalized. The success of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh reinforced the vision of Shri. K. Paul Thomas the Founder of ESAF. In 1995, he launched Micro Enterprises Development (MED) services and it resulted in the formation of ESAF Microfinance and Investments Pvt. Ltd., in 2008, giving importance of financial component in holistic economic development of the poor and marginalized. ESAF Microfinance and Investments Pvt. Ltd. was one of the pioneers in establishing a formal and structured form of lending through forming mutually trusted groups at the village level that could not only bring financial sustainability but also reinforced the fact that �the poor of our country are trustworthy�. In the remote and unbanked/under banked regions of the country, ESAF could cultivate a culture of financial discipline and also improved the workers participation rate as women too joined the workforce or started some income generation activity that could financially support their household. Financial literacy mission started by ESAF could not only bring know-how on how to spend wisely but also secure the future. ESAF has adopted a unique social business strategy, with a triple bottom line approach, emphasizing on People, Planet and Prosperity. The following are some of the highlights:

-For every rupee invested in ESAF, studies by international agencies revealed that the Social Return on Investment stood at Rs. 3.19.

-Some of the other changes brought about by ESAF are women�s access to employment, contribution to household income, access to and control over household resources, participation in household financial decision-making etc.

-ESAF could also gather a carbon offset of 20 million tones in the international market."
